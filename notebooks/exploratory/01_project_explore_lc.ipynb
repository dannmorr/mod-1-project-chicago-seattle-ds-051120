According to a recent The Seattle Times article, the number of OY in South King County has remained steadfast at 19,000<sup>4</sup>. However, that estimation comes from a report that is over three years old. As Data Science Consultants, your task is to **inform the SRP on the current status of OY in South King County using updated data.**\n",

Can then do this for other categories that we broke down in part 2 of the question.  \n",
