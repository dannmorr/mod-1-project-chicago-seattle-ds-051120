## Part 4

In this section we were looking for a trend between the 2016 report and our current data.

Reviewing the data provided by the 2016 report and comparing it to the numbers generated by our analysis in 2 & 3  we were struck by what appeared to be a remarkable drop in the number of OY.

While there is a significant difference in the number of OY in the data collected, when  the data is reframed to consider the makeup of the age groups by percentage rather than headcount, we see that there has not been a significant change in the overall makeup of the OY age groups.
